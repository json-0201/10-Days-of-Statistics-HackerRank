There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

CASE 1: RED(X,Y) + BLACK(Z)
4/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 10/63

CASE 2: RED(X,Z) + BLACK(Y)
4/7 * 4/9 * 4/8 = 8/63

CASE 3: RED(Y,Z) + BLACK(X)
3/7 * 5/9 * 4/8 = 15/126

ANSWER: 10/63 + 8/63 + 15/126 = 17/42
